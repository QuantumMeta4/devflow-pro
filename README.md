### Basic Analysis in Windsurf IDE
```rust
// Ask Cascade to analyze your code
"Please analyze this file for security issues"
"Can you optimize this code?"
"Check for potential memory leaks"

// Get real-time suggestions
"What improvements can be made at line 42?"
"Suggest optimizations for this function"
```

### ü§ñ Using DevFlow Pro with Cascade AI in Windsurf IDE

When using DevFlow Pro through Cascade AI in Windsurf IDE, you can leverage natural language interactions for powerful code analysis. Here's how to get the most out of it:

#### 1. Code Analysis and Security
```rust
// Request comprehensive analysis
User: "Analyze this entire file for potential issues"
Cascade: *Performs full analysis covering security, performance, and best practices*

// Focus on security
User: "Check this authentication function for security vulnerabilities"
Cascade: *Analyzes security aspects like input validation, encryption, and access control*

// Request specific security checks
User: "Look for SQL injection vulnerabilities in this query function"
Cascade: *Focuses on SQL-related security issues*
```

#### 2. Performance Optimization
```rust
// General optimization
User: "What performance improvements can be made in this file?"
Cascade: *Analyzes code for performance bottlenecks and suggests optimizations*

// Specific function optimization
User: "How can I make this data processing function faster?"
Cascade: *Provides targeted performance improvements for the function*

// Memory optimization
User: "Check for memory leaks in this resource handling code"
Cascade: *Analyzes memory management and suggests improvements*
```

#### 3. Code Quality and Best Practices
```rust
// Code review
User: "Review this module for Rust best practices"
Cascade: *Checks code against Rust idioms and community standards*

// Specific improvements
User: "How can I make this error handling more idiomatic?"
Cascade: *Suggests Rust-specific error handling improvements*

// Architecture review
User: "Is this the best way to structure these components?"
Cascade: *Analyzes architectural decisions and suggests improvements*
```

#### 4. Testing and Documentation
```rust
// Test generation
User: "Help me write tests for this API endpoint"
Cascade: *Generates comprehensive test cases with examples*

// Documentation
User: "Generate documentation for this module"
Cascade: *Creates documentation following Rust documentation standards*

// Test coverage
User: "What areas of this code need better test coverage?"
Cascade: *Analyzes test coverage and suggests additional tests*
```

#### 5. Real-time Assistance
```rust
// Context-aware help
User: "What's wrong with this line of code?"
Cascade: *Analyzes current line and provides specific guidance*

// Code completion
User: "How should I complete this function?"
Cascade: *Suggests appropriate code completion based on context*

// Error resolution
User: "Why am I getting this compiler error?"
Cascade: *Explains error and suggests fixes*
```

#### Best Practices for Cascade AI Interaction

1. **Be Specific**
   - ‚úÖ "Check this authentication function for SQL injection"
   - ‚ùå "Is this secure?"

2. **Provide Context**
   - ‚úÖ "This function handles user uploads. Are there any security issues?"
   - ‚ùå "Check for issues"

3. **Ask for Explanations**
   - ‚úÖ "Why is this approach better than using a Vec?"
   - ‚ùå "Fix this"

4. **Request Examples**
   - ‚úÖ "Show me how to implement this using async/await"
   - ‚ùå "Make it async"

5. **Iterate and Refine**
   - ‚úÖ "Now optimize the error handling in the part we just changed"
   - ‚ùå "Make everything better"

### üåà Key Features

### üìä Comprehensive Analysis

### üîë Together.xyz API Setup (Required)

#### 1. Get API Key
1. Visit [Together.xyz](https://www.together.xyz)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API settings
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy your API key

#### 2. Set Your API Key
Before using DevFlow Pro, you **must** set your Together.xyz API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:TOGETHER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# To make it permanent, add to your shell's config file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
echo 'export TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The application will not function without a valid Together.xyz API key. This is a security measure to ensure each user manages their own API access.
