# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

DevFlow Pro takes security seriously and employs multiple layers of protection to ensure code safety and prevent vulnerabilities. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting process, and security features.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. Static Analysis
- Automated detection of common security vulnerabilities
- Pattern matching for potential security issues:
  - Command injection vulnerabilities
  - SQL injection risks
  - Hardcoded secrets and credentials
  - Unsafe file operations
  - Unsafe deserialization
  - XSS vulnerabilities
  - Memory safety issues

### 2. AI-Enhanced Security Auditing
- Real-time code analysis using LLaMA-based AI models
- Security recommendations with confidence scores
- Detection of:
  - Unsafe code blocks
  - Improper error handling
  - Memory leak risks
  - Best practice violations

### 3. Access Control
- Secure API key management
- Environment variable-based configuration
- No hardcoded credentials

## 🚨 Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send a detailed report to OmegaPhiAI@gmail.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)
3. You should receive a response within 48 hours
4. Please allow up to 90 days for vulnerability fixes

### What to Include in Reports
- Affected versions
- Type of vulnerability
- Potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant code snippets
- Environment details

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### API Keys and Secrets
1. Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
2. Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Implement proper key rotation practices
4. Use `.env` files (but don't commit them)

### Code Safety
1. Avoid using `unsafe` blocks unless absolutely necessary
2. Properly handle errors instead of using `.unwrap()`
3. Use memory-safe alternatives to `Box::leak`
4. Implement proper input validation
5. Use parameterized queries for database operations

### File Operations
1. Validate file paths
2. Use safe file operation methods
3. Implement proper permission checks
4. Handle UTF-8 encoding correctly

## 🔄 Version Support

### Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 📝 Security Audit Process

1. **Automated Scanning**
   - Regular Clippy security lint checks
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Static code analysis

2. **Manual Review**
   - Code review requirements
   - Security-focused pull request templates
   - Regular security audits

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Runtime security checks
   - Error and exception monitoring
   - Access logging and analysis

## 🔒 Security Controls

### Authentication
- API key validation
- Token-based authentication
- Proper key storage and handling

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages
- No sensitive data in stack traces
- Proper logging practices

### Input Validation
- File type validation
- Size limits enforcement
- Content validation

## 📋 Compliance

- Follow Rust security best practices
- Adhere to OWASP secure coding guidelines
- Regular security updates and patches

## 🔄 Update Process

1. Security patches are released as soon as possible
2. Users are notified through GitHub releases
3. Critical updates are marked as such
4. Changelog includes security-relevant information
